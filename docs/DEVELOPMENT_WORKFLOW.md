# Development Workflow

## AI-Driven Development Process

### 1. Feature Development
- Use Amazon Q Developer for component scaffolding
- Generate TypeScript interfaces first
- Create components with AI assistance
- Add JSDoc comments via AI

### 2. Testing Strategy
- Generate unit tests with AI for each component
- Use Jest + React Testing Library
- Test coverage for edge cases and accessibility
- AI-generated integration tests

### 3. Code Review Process
- Use AI review tools before commits
- Small, focused commits with AI-generated summaries
- Automated code quality checks

### 4. Documentation
- README evolves with each feature
- AI-generated API documentation
- Inline comments for complex logic

## Commit Message Format
```
type(scope): AI-generated summary

- Bullet point of changes
- Generated by AI analysis of diff
```
