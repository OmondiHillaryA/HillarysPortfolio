## üß† AI Integration Strategy

### Code Generation
- **IDE Agent**: Amazon Q Developer for component scaffolding, utility functions, and boilerplate code
- **Feature Development**: Use context-aware prompts with existing codebase structure to generate consistent components
- **API Integration**: Generate type-safe API clients and data fetching logic

### Testing
- **Unit Tests**: AI-generated test cases for components using Jest and React Testing Library
- **Integration Tests**: Automated test scenarios for user workflows and API interactions
- **Test Prompts**: "Generate comprehensive tests for [component] covering edge cases and accessibility"

### Documentation
- **Docstrings**: AI-generated JSDoc comments for all functions and components
- **Inline Comments**: Context-aware explanations for complex logic
- **README Maintenance**: Automated updates to documentation as features evolve
- **API Documentation**: Auto-generated documentation from TypeScript interfaces

### Context-Aware Techniques
- **File Tree Context**: Feed complete project structure to AI for consistent naming and organization
- **API Specifications**: Include TypeScript interfaces and API contracts in prompts for accurate implementations
- **Diff Analysis**: Use git diffs in AI prompts for targeted code reviews and improvements
- **Component Library**: Maintain AI context of existing components to ensure design system consistency
